Problem Statement : Real-time Sports Scores

Problem Description: Develop a Godspeed API that fetches real-time sports scores from popular sports APIs like ESPN or Sports Radar. Apply meaningful business logic, such as live score updates or player statistics, and return a customised response. Implement JWT authentication, handle errors effectively, and provide detailed error messages. Utilise Kafka for asynchronous processing and use a cron job to update sports scores at regular intervals.

Specifications:
- Create an endpoint to fetch real-time sports scores for specific teams, leagues, or matches.
- Store that data in MongoDB.
- Implement logic for live score updates or player statistics retrieval.
- Provide relevant insights and statistics in the API response.
- Integrate JWT authentication for secure access to sports scores data.
- Implement error handling for API failures, invalid requests, and external API errors.
- Use Kafka for asynchronous message processing to enhance scalability.
- Set up a cron job to update sports scores periodically.
