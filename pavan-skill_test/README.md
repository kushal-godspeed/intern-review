### Problem Statement : Real-time News Aggregator

Problem Description: Build a Godspeed API that fetches real-time news articles from popular news sources like New York Times API  using their APIs. Apply meaningful business logic, such as sentiment analysis or categorization, and return a customised response. Implement JWT authentication, handle errors gracefully, and provide clear error messages. Utilise Kafka for message streaming and implement a cron job to fetch updated news articles at regular intervals.

Specifications:
- Create an endpoint to fetch real-time news articles from the above API.
- Store that data in MongoDB.
- Implement sentiment analysis or categorization to provide insights on news articles.
- Integrate JWT authentication for secure access to news data.
- Implement error handling for API failures, invalid requests, and external API errors.
- Use Kafka for asynchronous message processing and enhance scalability.
- Set up a cron job to fetch updated news articles periodically.
