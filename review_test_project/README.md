### Problem Statement : Real-time Stock Market Information

Problem Description: Develop a Godspeed API that fetches real-time stock market data from a popular financial API like Alpha Vantage. Apply meaningful business logic, such as calculating stock price changes or predicting market trends, and return a customized response. Implement JWT authentication, handle errors effectively, and provide detailed error messages. Integrate Kafka for asynchronous processing and use a cron job to update stock data at regular intervals.

Specifications:
- Create an endpoint to fetch real-time stock market data for a specific company or ticker symbol.
- Store that data in MongoDB.
- Implement logic to calculate stock price changes or predict market trends based on historical data.
- Provide relevant insights and predictions in the API response.
- Integrate JWT authentication for secure access to stock market data.
- Implement error handling for API failures, invalid requests, and external API errors.
- Use Kafka for asynchronous message processing to enhance scalability.
- Set up a cron job to update stock market data periodically.
